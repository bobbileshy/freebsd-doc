For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/>.

I.   Background

Heimdal implements the Kerberos 5 network authentication protocols.
The Kerberos protocol uses "ticket" to authenticate a client to a
service.

A Key Distribution Center (KDC) is trusted by all principals registered
in that administrative "realm" to store a secret key in confidence, of
which, the proof of knowledge is used to verify the authenticity of a
principal.


II.  Problem Description

There is a programming error in Heimdal implementation that used an
unauthenticated, plain-text version of the KDC-REP service name found
in a ticket.

III. Impact

An attacker who has control to the network between a client and the
service it talks to will be able to impersonate the service, allowing
a successful man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that circumvents the mutual
authentication.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but only Kerberos enabled clients are
affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

A reboot is recommended.

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

A reboot is recommended.

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:05/heimdal.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-17:05/heimdal.patch.asc
# gpg --verify heimdal.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in <URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/makeworld.html>.

Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.

VI.  Correction details

The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
