I.   Background

Hyper-V is a default hypervisor provided on Windows server by Microsoft.
ATA driver is the legacy storage driver for FreeBSD on Hyperv, now they
are replaced by synthetic driver which has better performance.

There are issues when attaching multiple synthetic storage driver for
FreeBSD 10.3 on some of Hyper-V hosts.

CD/DVD cannot be detected in some circumstances which cause provisioning
fail on Azure.

II.  Problem Description

The disk INQUIRY response is not complete for FreeBSD 10.3 on some
Hyper-V hosts, which will cause the disks will be detached during boot.

An interrupt is missing if we allow intr_shuffle_irqs on Hyper-V.

III. Impact

FreeBSD 10.3 can not be boot properly on a guest system on Hyper-V host.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security
branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

A reboot is required.

2) To update your system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

A reboot is required.

3) To update your system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:06/hyperv.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/EN-17:06/hyperv.patch.asc
# gpg --verify hyperv.patch.asc

b) Apply the patch.  Execute the following commands as root:

# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch

c) Recompile your kernel as described in
<URL:https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
