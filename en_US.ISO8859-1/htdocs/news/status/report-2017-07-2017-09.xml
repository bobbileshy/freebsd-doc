      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting
	and publishing release schedules for official project releases
	of &os;, announcing code freezes, and maintaining the
	respective branches, among other things.</p>

      <p>The &os; Release Engineering Team continued finalizing the
	11.1-RELEASE cycle, with the final release builds starting on
	July 21 and the official release announcement email sent on
	July 26.  Thank you to everyone who helped test 11.1-RELEASE,
	ensuring its quality and stability.&nbsp;[1]</p>

      <p>&os;&nbsp;11.1-RELEASE is the second release from the
	<tt>stable/11</tt> branch.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the &os; Release Engineering Team started the
	10.4-RELEASE cycle, with the code slush starting on July 28.
	With the final release build expected to start on September 29
	and the official announcement overlapping the end of the
	quarter, everything is on schedule as of this
	writing.&nbsp;[2]</p>

      <p>&os;&nbsp;10.4-RELEASE will be the fifth release from the
	<tt>stable/10</tt> branch, and is planned to be the final release
	of the 10.x series.</p>

    <title>AMD Zen (family 17h) support</title>

      <p>This quarter, a bit of work was done to enhance platform
	support for AMD Zen (Ryzen, Threadripper, Epyc) processors:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The CPU topology detection code was enhanced to properly
	  detect Zen dies and CCXes.  This gives the scheduler more
	  locality information to make scheduling decisions.</li>

	<li>The x86 topology analysis was enhanced to report dies and
	  CCXes, in addition to the existing reporting on packages,
	  cores, and threads.  An example  of the new output is
	  &quot;FreeBSD/SMP: 1 package(s) x 2 groups x 2 cache groups
	  x 4 core(s) x 2 hardware threads&quot;.</li>

	<li>The amdsmn(4) driver for accessing SMN (System Management
	  Network) registers was added.</li>

	<li>CPU temperature monitoring support for Zen was added to
	  amdtemp(4).</li>

	<li>In cpufreq(4):
	  <ul>
	    <li>Added support for decoding Zen P-state info from MSRs
	      (mostly not necessary due to ACPI P-state information,
	      but potentially useful)</li>

	    <li>Work around the apparent Ryzen inability to achieve
	      the P1 state by not busying cores waiting to
	      transition.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li>The intpm(4) smbus driver was fixed to attach to FCH
	  (Fusion Controller Hub).</li>

	<li>All MCA banks are now enabled and monitored on Zen
	  CPUs.</li>

	<li>Feature bit decoding was added for: CLZERO, SVM features,
	  RAS capabilities.</li>

	<li>SHA intrinsic support was added to the aesni(4) driver.
	  Ryzen is currently the only desktop processor to feature
	  these intrinsics.  Support is also present in Intel's
	  Goldmont line of low end SoCs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Overall, Zen is now a very usable platform for x86
	workstations and servers.</p>

      <p>The port has been updated to GDB 8.0.</p>

      <p>Support for &os;/aarch64 userland binaries has been committed
	upstream.  These patches, along with support for debugging
	&os;/aarch64 kernels, have been committed to the port.</p>

      <p>Upstream patches adding improved support for &os;/arm userland
	binaries are currently in review.  &os; 12 has recently grown
	support for debugging VFP registers via <tt>ptrace()</tt> and
	core dumps as part of this work.  Support for &os;/arm kernels
	will be added to the port after the upstream patches are added
	to the port.</p>

       <p>Support for <tt>$_siginfo</tt> has been committed upstream.
	 This uses the recently added NT_LWPINFO note to extract
	 signal information from process cores.</p>

       <p>Hangs that occured when GDB's <tt>kill</tt> command was used
	 were fixed in &os; in r313992.</p>

      <p>This summer has seen the creation of a puppet@ team to help
	maintain the ~30 Puppet-related ports in the &os; ports tree.
	These ports were previously maintained by various committers,
	and from time to time this introduced some delays when
	updating a port due to the need to wait for a maintainer's
	approval for a related change to a different port.</p>

      <p>Puppet 5 is now in the ports tree (as
	<tt>sysutils/puppet5</tt>).  The C++ version of Facter
	(<tt>sysutils/facter</tt>) got a lot of love and is now a
	drop-in replacement for the previous Ruby version of Facter
	(<tt>sysutils/rubygem-facter</tt>); it is the default facts
	source for the Puppet 5 port.</p>

      <p>Work continues on bringing in Puppetserver 5 to the ports
	tree, and on keeping all the ports up-to-date.</p>

      <task>The <tt>databases/puppetdb[345]</tt> and
	<tt>sysutils/puppetserver[45]</tt> ports rely on Clojure and
