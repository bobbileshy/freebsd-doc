    <p>Many projects build upon &os; or incorporate components of
      &os; into their project.  As these projects may be of interest 
      to the broader &os; community, we sometimes include brief
      updates submitted by these projects in our quarterly report.
      The &os; project makes no representation as to the accuracy or
      veracity of any claims in these submissions.</p>

    <body>
      <p>LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network
	monitoring solution which includes support for a wide range of
	network hardware and operating systems, including Cisco,
	Linux, &os;, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and many more.</p>

      <p>Among other things, it can monitor applications and other
	functionality running on a server via SNMP extensions.  This
	has been the area of focus for my present work.</p>

      <p>ZFS support has been committed towards the end of December,
	which was too late to make the December release, but it will
	be in the January release.</p>

      <p>This brings the ability to monitor ARC and pool information,
	with each pool having its own separate set of graphs.</p>

      <p>The ARC graphing is as below.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>ARC size in bytes</li>

	<li>ARC size, percent of max size</li>

	<li>ARC size breakdown</li>

	<li>ARC efficiency</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits by list</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits by type</li>

	<li>ARC cache misses by type</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits</li>

	<li>ARC cache misses</li>

	<li>ARC misc (deleted, skips, and recycle misses)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The pool tracking is comparatively much simpler, using the
	output from <tt>zpool list</tt>.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Pool Space</li>

	<li>Pool Capacity</li>

	<li>Pool Fragmentation</li>
      </ul>

    <title>RDMA stack update based on Linux v4.9</title>

    <body>
      <p>An update to the &os; RDMA stack based on code from Linux
	v4.9 was merged into &os; 12-CURRENT on November 4th,
	including many bug fixes and new features with a focus on
	RoCEv2 &mdash; Routable RoCE.</p>

      <p>RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) is a network protocol
	that leverages Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capabilities
	to accelerate communications between applications hosted on
	clusters of servers and storage arrays.  RoCE incorporates the
	IBTA RDMA semantics to allow devices to perform direct memory
	to memory transfers at the application level without involving
	the host CPU.  Both the transport processing and the memory
	translation and placement are performed by hardware resulting
	in lower latency, higher throughput, and better performance
	compared to software based protocols.</p>

      <p>RoCEv2 is the most recent version of RoCE, adding some routing
	capabilities as both IP and UDP headers are included in the
	packet format.  To complete the RoCEv2 solution, Support for
	ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification, lossy fabric) and PFC
	(Priority Flow Control, lossless fabric) protocols with rate
	limiting options will be added in the first quarter of
	2018.</p>

      <p>This project also introduces the following updates:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><tt>libibverbs</tt>, <tt>librdmacm</tt>,
	  <tt>libibumad</tt> and vendor-specific libraries
	  ported from the Linux rdma-core v15+</li>

	<li>InfiniBand diagnostic tools,
	  <tt>infiniband-diags</tt>, version 1.6.7</li>

	<li>InfiniBand subnet manager &mdash; OpenSM, version 3.3.20+</li>

	<li>LinuxKPI support</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Important notes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>GPL-only (non dual-licensed) portions of the Linux code were either
	excluded or written from scratch under a BSD license by
	&a.hselasky;.</li>

	<li>The code has been tested by several RDMA vendors
	  that also support iWARP.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The last quarter of 2017 ended with over 27,000 ports in the
	repository.  There are currently just under 2,800 open ports
	PRs with 685 of them unassigned.  There were 6,700 commits
	made by 178 committers.  The statistics did not change much
	since last quarter, however the number of unassigned PRs
	dropped slightly.</p>

      <p>This quarter, we welcomed Yuri Victorovich (yuri@), Jason
	Bacon (jwb@), and Wolfram Scheider (wosch@) as new or
	returning port committers.  No commit bits were taken in for
	safekeeping.</p>

      <p>Portmgr, together with postmaster@, changed the policy of the
	FreeBSD-ports@ mailing list.  It is now required to be
	subscribed to the list before one can post to it.  This will
	help in reducing spam on this list and help users finding
	better questions to their answers while browsing the list
	archive.</p>

      <p>This quarter ports &quot;flavors&quot; went live.  Flavors
	can be used to build multiple variations of a port, for
	example <tt>py27-sarge</tt> and <tt>py36-sarge</tt>.  All
	Python ports and some other ports are now flavored.  Other
	uses of flavors could be including or excluding X11
	(<tt>foo</tt> vs <tt>foo-x11</tt> or <tt>foo-nox11</tt>) or
	selecting the printer paper size (A4 vs letter).</p>

      <p><tt>USES=fmake</tt> has been removed as it was no longer
	useful.</p>

      <p>Some default versions got updated: Ruby to 2.4 and Samba to
	4.6.  Firefox got updated to version 57.0.3 and <tt>pkg</tt> to
	1.10.3.</p>

      <p>During the last quarter, antoine@ ran 33 exp-runs to validate changes
	to the base system, fix Qt5 ports, test Python flavors and other port
	updates, and make rubygem port builds reproducible.</p>

      <task>Clang 6 is being imported into base.  There is a PR that keeps track
	of ports failing with this compiler, see <url
	  href="http://bugs.FreeBSD.org/224669">PR 224669</url>.  If you use
	any ports mentioned here, please consider fixing them.</task>
