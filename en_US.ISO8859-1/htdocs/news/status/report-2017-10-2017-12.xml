    <description>Third-Party Projects</description>

    <p>Many projects build upon &os; or incorporate components of
      &os; into their project.  As these projects may be of interest 
      to the broader &os; community, we sometimes include brief
      updates submitted by these projects in our quarterly report.
      The &os; project makes no representation as to the accuracy or
      veracity of any claims in these submissions.</p>

    <body>
      <p>LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network
	monitoring solution which includes support for a wide range of
	network hardware and operating systems, including Cisco,
	Linux, &os;, Juniper, Brocade, Foundry, HP and many more.</p>

      <p>Among other things, it can monitor applications and other
	functionality running on a server via SNMP extensions.  This
	has been the area of focus for my present work.</p>

      <p>ZFS support has been committed towards the end of December,
	which was too late to make the December release, but it will
	be in the January release.</p>

      <p>This brings the ability to monitor ARC and pool information,
	with each pool having its own separate set of graphs.</p>

      <p>The ARC graphing is as below.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>ARC size in bytes</li>

	<li>ARC size, percent of max size</li>

	<li>ARC size breakdown</li>

	<li>ARC efficiency</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits by list</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits by type</li>

	<li>ARC cache misses by type</li>

	<li>ARC cache hits</li>

	<li>ARC cache misses</li>

	<li>ARC misc (deleted, skips, and recycle misses)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The pool tracking is comparatively much simpler, using the
	output from <tt>zpool list</tt>.</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Pool Space</li>

	<li>Pool Capacity</li>

	<li>Pool Fragmentation</li>
      </ul>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>Suggestions are needed for additional statistics or other
	information to monitor, whether &os;-specific or
	otherwise.</task>
