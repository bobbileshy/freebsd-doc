    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
      deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
      upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

    <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to
      which these release notes apply represents the latest point
      along the &release.branch; development branch since
      &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built,
      binary &release.type; distributions along this branch can be
      found at <uri
	xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri>.</para>

    <para releasetype="snapshot">The &release.type; distribution to
      which these release notes apply represents a point along the
      &release.branch; development branch between &release.prev; and
      the future &release.next;.  Information regarding pre-built,
      binary &release.type; distributions along this branch can be
      found at <uri
	xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri>.</para>

    <para releasetype="release">This distribution of &os;
      &release.current; is a &release.type; distribution.  It can be
      found at <uri xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri> or
      any of its mirrors.  More information on obtaining this (or
      other) &release.type; distributions of &os; can be found in the
      <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
	  &os;</quote> appendix</link> to the <link
	xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
	Handbook</link>.</para>

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata
      before installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
      to documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <para>This document describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.  In general, changes
      described here are unique to the &release.branch; branch unless
      specifically marked as &merged; features.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="upgrade">
    <title>Upgrading from Previous Releases of &os;</title>

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions
      (and snapshots of the various security branches) are supported
      using the &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade
      procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as
      unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an official
      &os; release.  The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that
      the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

    <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
      base system from source code) from previous versions are
      supported, according to the instructions in
      <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Upgrading &os; should only be attempted after backing up
	<emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration files.</para>

    <title>General Notes Regarding Future &os; Releases</title>

    <sect2 xml:id="future-releases-cputype">
      <title>Default <varname>CPUTYPE</varname> Change</title>

      <para>Starting with &os;-13.0, the default
	<varname>CPUTYPE</varname> for the &arch.i386;
	architecture will change from <literal>486</literal> to
	<literal>686</literal>.</para>

      <para>This means that, by default, binaries produced will
	require a 686-class <acronym>CPU</acronym>, including but
	not limited to binaries provided by the &os;&nbsp;Release
	Engineering team.  &os;&nbsp;13.0 will continue to support
	older <acronym>CPU</acronym>s, however users needing this
	functionality will need to build their own releases for
	official support.</para>

      <para>As the primary use for i486 and i586
	<acronym>CPU</acronym>s is generally in the embedded market,
	the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new
	hardware with these <acronym>CPU</acronym> types has long
	faded, and much of the deployed base of such systems is
	nearing retirement age, statistically.</para>

      <para>There were several factors taken into account for this
	change.  For example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and
	while they can be emulated in the kernel, they cannot be
	emulated in the userland.  Additionally, the 32-bit amd64
	libraries have been i686 since their inception.</para>

      <para>As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers
	using the lib32 libraries on 64-bit hardware with the
	<varname>COMPAT_FREEBSD32</varname> option in the kernel,
	this change ensures better coverage and user experience.
	This also aligns with what the majority of &linux;
	distributions have been doing for quite some time.</para>

      <para>This is expected to be the final bump of the default
	<varname>CPUTYPE</varname> in &arch.i386;.</para>

      <para>
	<important>
	  <para>This change does not affect the &os;&nbsp;12.x or
	    11.x series of releases.</para>
