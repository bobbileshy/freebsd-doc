    <h2>&os; Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>The &os; Project is inclusive.  We want the &os; Project
      to be a venue where people of all backgrounds can work together
      to make the best operating system, built by a strong community.
      These values extend beyond just development to all aspects of
      the Project.  All those given recognition as members of the
      Project in whatever form are seen as ambassadors of the
      Project.</p>

    <p>Diversity is a huge strength and is critical to the long term
      success of the Project.  To that end we have a few ground rules
      that we ask people to adhere to.  This code applies equally to
      everyone representing the &os; Project in any way, from new
      members, to committers, to the core team itself.  These rules
      are intended to ensure a safe, harassment-free environment for
      all and to ensure that everyone feels welcome both working
      within, and interacting with, the Project.</p>

    <p>This document is not an exhaustive list of things that you
      should not do.  Rather, consider it a guide to make it easier to
      enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we
      participate.</p>

    <p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces used by the &os;
      Project, including our mailing lists, IRC channels, and social
      media, both online and off.  Anyone who is found to violate this
      code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from &os;
      Project controlled spaces at the discretion of the &os; Code
      of Conduct Committee.</p>

    <p>Some &os; Project spaces may have additional rules in place,
      which will be made clearly available to participants.
      Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these
      rules.  Harassment includes but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Comments that reinforce systemic oppression related to
	gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
	disability, mental illness, neurodiversity, physical
	appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>

      <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices
	and practices, including those related to food, health,
	parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>

      <li>Deliberate misgendering.</li>

      <li>Deliberate use of &quot;dead&quot; or rejected names.</li>

      <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces
	where they're not appropriate.</li>

      <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g.,
	textual descriptions like &quot;*hug*&quot; or
	&quot;*backrub*&quot;) without consent or after a request
	to stop.</li>

      <li>Threats of violence.</li>

      <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including
	encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in
	self-harm.</li>

      <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>

      <li>Stalking or following.</li>

      <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online
	activity for harassment purposes.</li>

      <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>

      <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>

      <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as
	requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with
	others.</li>

      <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to
	cease.</li>

      <li>Deliberate &quot;outing&quot; of any private aspect of a
	person's identity without their consent except as necessary to
	protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without
	consent.</li>

      <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication with
	consent but in a way that intentionally misrepresents the
	communication (e.g., removes context that changes the
	meaning).</li>

      <li>Knowingly making harmful false claims about a person.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Glossary</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Systemic oppression:</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>The ways in which history, culture, ideology, public
	  policies, institutional practices, and personal behaviors
	  and beliefs interact to maintain a hierarchy &mdash; based
	  on race, class, gender, sexuality, and/or other group
	  identities &mdash; that allows the privileges associated
	  with the dominant group and the disadvantages associated
	  with the oppressed, targeted, or marginalized group to
	  endure and adapt over time.  (Derived from Aspen Institute,
	  via Open Source Leadership)</p></dd>

      <dt>Dead names:</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>A name assigned to a person at birth which they no longer
	  identify with.  Most often used to refer to the assigned
	  name of a trans person who has publicly identified
	  themselves under a new name.  Deliberately using a dead name
	  is an act of hostility.</p></dd></dl>
